== JRuby HDFS

This is an interface to the Hadoop Distributed Filesystem.
It uses the Java API thus, only JRuby is supported.

== Getting Started

1. Run the tests

Install and start Hadoop (at least hdfs) and set HADOOP_HOME environment variable,
then run

    rake

Please note that the tests will modify your HDFS (add/remove files and paths).
You might want to run a separate HDFS just for the tests!
